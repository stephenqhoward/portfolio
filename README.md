Upon graduation from Code Platoon – programming boot camp, a friend of mine, who is a senior developer, asked if I would be interested in learning Typescript and Next.js to build a friend's new law practice website: https://urankarlaw.com. As neither of us are designers, we used a themed template as a reference to build a responsive layout.

My personal contribution was the layout and alignment of each section on the page – building reusable components and styling with Tailwind CSS. From there the senior developer and I would pair program in order to optimize the page's responsiveness for mobile. I was unavailable to work on the top menu, however, we have a few more features to add before the project is complete.
